CHANGES
=======

tip (unreleased)
----------------

- Fixed using SplitField on an abstract base model.

- Added pending-deprecation warnings for ``InheritanceCastModel``,
  ``manager_from``, and Django 1.1 support. Removed documentation for the
  deprecated utilities. Bumped ``ChoiceEnum`` from pending-deprecation to
  deprecation.

0.6.0 (2011.02.18)
------------------

- Fixed issue #6, bug with InheritanceManager and descriptor fields (e.g.
  FileField).  Thanks zyegfryed for the fix and sayane for tests.

- updated SplitField to define get_prep_value rather than get_db_prep_value.
  This avoids deprecation warnings on Django trunk/1.3, but makes SplitField
  incompatible with Django versions prior to 1.2.

- added InheritanceManager, a better approach to selecting subclass instances
  for Django 1.2+. Thanks Jeff Elmore.

- added InheritanceCastManager and InheritanceCastQuerySet, to allow bulk
  casting of a queryset to child types.  Thanks Gregor MÃ¼llegger.

------------------

- added manager_from (thanks George Sakkis)

  (thanks Jannis Leidel)
